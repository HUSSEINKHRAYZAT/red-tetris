# Example environment variables for the frontend (Vite)
# Copy this file to `.env` in the client/ folder and edit values as needed.
# Vite exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the client build.

# Full backend HTTP URL (used by fetch, assets, etc.).
# If omitted, the app will default to the current browser origin.
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Full Socket URL for Socket.IO client (if different from VITE_BACKEND_URL).
# If omitted, the frontend will use VITE_BACKEND_URL (or current origin) as socket URL.
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Backend port used to construct a fallback URL when running locally.
VITE_BACKEND_PORT=3000

# Example for production when backend is hosted at a different origin:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://api.my-domain.com
# VITE_SOCKET_URL=wss://sockets.my-domain.com
