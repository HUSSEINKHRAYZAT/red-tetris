# Example environment variables for the frontend (Vite)
# Copy this file to `.env` in the client/ folder and edit values as needed.
# Vite exposes variables prefixed with VITE_ to the client build.

# Full backend HTTP URL (used by fetch, assets, etc.).
# If omitted, the app will default to the current browser origin.
# To test from other devices on your LAN, set this to your machine's LAN IP (e.g. 192.168.1.42)
# Example (replace <LAN_IP> with your actual local IP):
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://<LAN_IP>:3000
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Full Socket URL for Socket.IO client (if different from VITE_BACKEND_URL).
# If omitted, the frontend will use VITE_BACKEND_URL (or current origin) as socket URL.
# For LAN testing, set to the same LAN IP as above:
# VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://<LAN_IP>:3000
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Backend port used to construct a fallback URL when running locally.
VITE_BACKEND_PORT=3000

# Notes:
# 1) Find your LAN IP on Linux: `hostname -I` or `ip addr show` (pick the address on your local network, usually 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x).
# 2) Ensure your backend binds to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces) or that your server is reachable on that LAN IP (the server in this project binds to 0.0.0.0 by default in dev).
# 3) If you run the frontend dev server (Vite), set `server.host` to `true` in `vite.config.ts` so the dev server is accessible from other devices.
# 4) For production builds, set these variables to your deployed backend/sockets origins (https/wss as appropriate).

# Example for production when backend is hosted at a different origin:
# VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://api.my-domain.com
# VITE_SOCKET_URL=wss://sockets.my-domain.com
